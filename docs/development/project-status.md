## Current Task

- FO-074F corrects a confirmed Critical cross-tenant FM Ticket access defect.
  Backend-authoritative scope now protects list, detail, nested actions,
  creation, update, assignment, Work Order generation, escalation, and status
  changes. Focused isolation coverage is included in the 80-test FM Ticket
  suite; Maintenance 85, Notifications 78, Accounts/Access Control 113, and
  full backend 611 pass. Django check and migration drift are clean. No
  frontend or schema change is included. Independent review remains pending.

## Next Milestone

- Independent review and approval of the FO-074F security correction
- Employee Requester Experience follows only after security approval; FO-075
  has not started and no feature branch exists
- FO-063 automatic Ticket closure remains reserved and deferred

## Completed Feature — Master Data Management

- Feature: Master Data Management hardening
- Merged to `main` through PR #40 at
  `35085bf2dafdf93b06e209643c4f9a5d30bb676e`
- FO-071: tenant isolation and write-path hardening (complete; independently approved by Sol on 2026-07-18 at `6721ff0ff84d55ae5aaa0bb875b0cdc03ebbc9ec` in the external project collaboration session)
- FO-072: soft-delete / deactivation lifecycle / hierarchy integrity (complete and independently approved at final HEAD `a8ea862` per user governance)
- FO-073: frontend lifecycle and administrative UX alignment (complete; manual browser acceptance not performed; not independently approved)

- FO-074A: manual acceptance passed on 2026-07-19 after follow-up corrections
- FO-074B: Boolean filter correction complete
- FO-074C: Facility Manager RBAC and Staff authorization reconciliation
  complete
- FO-074D: final validation and manual acceptance reconciliation complete;
  full backend 593 passed
- FO-074E: Sol independent cumulative final review APPROVED; repository and
  PR reconciled before the normal merge-commit action
- Access: `settings.view` / `settings.manage`, with backend-authoritative tenant scope
- Organization Management remains a thin consumer of Master Data APIs
- FO-063: remains separately reserved for automatic FM Ticket closure
- FO-075: not started; Employee Requester Experience remains next

## Foundation Dashboard Security Note

- FO-017 originally used globally scoped foundation counts.
- FO-068 corrects tenant isolation on the cumulative Dashboard branch.
- Reporting aggregations remain separately tenant-scoped (FO-064 through FO-067B; PR #38 merged).
- Dashboard remains independent of Reporting business aggregation.

## Known Issues

- Frontend test coverage remains helper-level; no component, integration, or browser harness exists yet.
- Repository versioning is commit-based today; no release tags are present.
- Module merge workflow is still manual and depends on branch discipline plus tracker accuracy.
- Cross-tab realtime refresh is not implemented; separately opened tabs may require manual refresh.
- Attachment upload remains deferred and is guidance-only in Maintenance Create/Edit.
- Browser-test automation remains deferred.
