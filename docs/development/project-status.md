## Known Issues

- Frontend test coverage remains helper-level (`npm run test`, 87 tests); no component, integration, or browser harness exists yet.
- Repository versioning is commit-based today; no release tags are present.
- Module merge workflow is still manual and depends on branch discipline plus
  tracker accuracy.
- Canonical full backend suite baseline for Roles and Permissions validation is 250 tests (`python manage.py test --parallel 4 --noinput` from `backend/`).
- Canonical full backend suite for current repository validation discovers 291 tests under `python manage.py test --parallel 4 --noinput` in `backend/`; multiprocessing worker teardown trace output can intermittently appear in this environment during parallel execution.
